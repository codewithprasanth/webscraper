## 🔐 Phone Number Format

### How to Format Your WhatsApp Number

```
Remove the leading zero and '+' symbol, then add country code

Example 1 (India):
  Original: +91 7200632341
  Format:   917200632341@c.us

Example 2 (USA):
  Original: +1 202-555-1234
  Format:   12025551234@c.us

Example 3 (UK):
  Original: +44 20 7183 8750
  Format:   442071838750@c.us
```

**Key Rules:**
- No '+' symbol
- No spaces or hyphens
- No leading zero
- Include country code
- End with @c.us

- Respect website's Terms of Service
- Don't use very short scrape intervals (<30s)
- Website structure may change over time
- Some sites may block automated access

### This Tool
- Uses WhatsApp Web (may violate ToS)
- Use at your own risk
- Don't share your .env file
- Keep credentials safe

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### QR Code Not Showing?
```bash
rm -rf .wwebjs_auth/
npm run dev
```

### Wrong Phone Number Format?
```
✅ Correct:   917200632341@c.us
❌ Wrong:     +917200632341@c.us
❌ Wrong:     91 7200632341@c.us
❌ Wrong:     7200632341@c.us (missing country code)
```

### Not Getting Offers?
- Check `MIN_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE` (too high?)
- Check `PRODUCT_KEYWORDS` (specific enough?)
- Set `DEBUG_MODE=true` to see what's happening
- Verify roobai.com is loading correctly

### Messages Not Sending?
- Verify phone number in .env
- Keep WhatsApp app open on phone
- Ensure phone has internet
- Check server logs for errors
